    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat for best juiciness)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce (optional, for umami)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter or oil (for cooking)</li>
        <li>Cheese slices (cheddar, American, etc.)</li>
        <li>Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayo</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix: Gently combine beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, 
            and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Avoid overmixing to keep patties tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape: Divide into 4 equal portions. Form into ¾-inch (2cm) thick patties, 
            slightly wider than your buns (they shrink). 
            Press a small dent in the center to prevent bulging.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stovetop: Heat butter/oil in a skillet over medium-high. 
            Cook patties 3–4 mins per side for medium (160°F/71°C internal temp). 
            Add cheese in the last minute to melt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill: Cook over direct high heat for the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest: Let patties rest 2 mins before assembling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble: Layer patty, cheese, and toppings on toasted buns. Serve immediately!
